# YES3 Scanner: Yet Another S3 Scanner

YES3 scans an AWS Account for potential S3 security issues in the following categories:

* Access Issues such as Public Access
* Preventative S3 Security Settings
* Additional Security such as Encryption
* Ransomware Protection, Data Protection, and Recovery

For help or feedback, contact us at [info@fogsecurity.io](mailto:info@fogsecurity.io).  We are continuing to build in this space and are developing a more comprehensive scanner with multi-account (Organization) and object-level scanning.  If you're interested in joining a private beta, reach out to us.
